# STAT184_FinalProject

This is my final project for STAT 184. It requires multiple steps, starting with Preliminary EDA and ending with a report and presentation.

## Preliminary EDA
Based on the given instructions and rubric, below are some things I kept in mind while going through this phase of my project.

### Guiding Question (research question):
Have a single guiding/research question that will drive my analysis. It should be phrase as a question that I can try to investigate.

### Become acquainted with my data sources:
- where did it come from?
- who collected/maintains them?
- when & why were they originally collected?
- what does a case represent in each data source, & how many total cases are available?
- what are some of the variables that I plan to use?
**NOTE:** The R Notebook will contain R code chunks and output, as well as narrative for the questions above.

### Explore intuition related to the research question
- create informative plots & summary statistics
- describe preliminary observations & intuition about the research question

### Data Sources (at least two)

**Primary data:** Main data source that includes at least hundreds (preferably many thousands) of cases as well as many variables, including a mixture of both categorical & quantitative variables. This is not loaded from an R package.

**Other data sources:** This can be from an R package or somewhere else.
