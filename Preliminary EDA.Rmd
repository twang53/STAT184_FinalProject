## Introduction

### Research Question
**How do the number of languages spoken at home affect English speaking ability?**
I want to see how the number of languages and the type of language(s) spoken at home can affect a person's ability to speak English well. I have a couple data sources to analyze that, one based on counties in the US, one based on the states in the US, and one of the US (the nation) overall. I may look for more datasets to add so that there's a bit more "color" and makes the entire project more interesting.

## The Data


### Questions
- where did it come from?
- who collected/maintains them?
- when & why were they originally collected?
- what does a case represent in each data source, & how many total cases are available?
- what are some of the variables that I plan to use?
